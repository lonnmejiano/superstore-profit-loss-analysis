**Project Type**: Business Intelligence Dashboard  
**Tools Used**: Tableau, Excel, SQL 
**Status**: Completed | June 2025  
**Role**: Analyst, Visual Storyteller, Dashboard Developer

## 📌 Overview

This project investigates **profit and loss patterns** within a fictional Superstore dataset, focusing on how **return rates** impact overall business performance. As a Business Intelligence Analyst, I developed a multi-layered Tableau dashboard to deliver actionable insights to stakeholders — guiding data-driven decisions for the Supply Chain and Sales teams.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify **high-return, low-profit segments**
- Visualize **monthly profit trends** across regions and categories
- Analyze **correlations** between sales and return rates
- Support **executive decision-making** with interactive dashboards

---

## 🛠️ Methods & Techniques

- **Data Preparation**:
  - Cleaned Excel datasets and created calculated fields for return rate logic
  - Used conditional logic (`IF NULL → 0, IF 'Yes' → 1`) to simulate binary return indicators

- **Visual Analysis**:
  - **Dual-Axis Charts**: Sales vs. Return Rate
  - **Category Drilldowns**: Profitability by Segment, Region, and Product Line
  - **Geographic Heat Maps**: Visualized return trends across U.S. regions

- **KPIs Tracked**:
  - Return Rate = `SUM([Returned]) / COUNT([Order ID])`
  - Net Profit = `Sales - Returns - Discounts`
  - Monthly Loss Concentration

---

## 📈 Results & Insights

- 📉 **Identified Categories**: High return rates in Office Supplies and Technology segments led to **net losses** in key months
- 📍 **Region-Specific Trends**: Western and Southern regions showed **disproportionate return activity**
- 🔄 **Strategic Recommendations**:
  - Adjust supplier contracts for high-return items
  - Review fulfillment issues linked to returns
  - Increase QA measures on products with >10% return rates

## 📌 Strategic Recommendation

Based on the profit-impact analysis, the following strategies are recommended:

- 🛠️ **Supplier Review & Renegotiation**: High return rates in Office Supplies and Technology suggest the need to review product quality and renegotiate supplier contracts to include return allowances.

- 🧾 **Enhance Product QA Controls**: Implement stricter quality assurance protocols for products with return rates exceeding 10%, especially those with historically negative margins.

- 🚚 **Logistics Process Optimization**: Investigate fulfillment and packaging procedures in Western and Southern regions, which showed higher return incidents. This may include reviewing carrier performance or warehouse handling procedures.

- 📢 **Customer Experience Feedback Loop**: Introduce post-return surveys to identify dissatisfaction drivers, enabling proactive improvements and minimizing repeat returns.

These actions aim to reduce unnecessary revenue loss, improve supply chain efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction — ultimately supporting SuperStore’s bottom-line performance.
